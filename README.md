This repository attempt predicting chromatin conformation from various chromatin factors using a neural network.
The network implementation is strongly based on the paper [Dense neural networks for predicting chromatin conformation](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2286-z) 
by Farre, Heurteau, Cuvier and Emberly (2018).
